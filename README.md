# Mobile Applications I Project 3 - Simple Calculator Application Design

## Description

This project is a simple calculator application design created in Xcode using Swift. The design adheres to the concepts learned in Module 3, focusing on user interface (UI) design principles and implementation.

## Design Overview

The calculator application design aims to provide a clean and intuitive user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. It incorporates the following key features:

### Simple Interface: The UI features a minimalist design with easy-to-read buttons and clear display area for input and output.
### StackViews: Utilization of StackViews for organizing and arranging UI elements, ensuring adaptability across different device sizes and orientations.
### Responsive Layout: The application is designed to run seamlessly on all size classes, including iPads, and supports both portrait and landscape orientations.

## Design Guidelines

### Use of StackViews: StackViews are used to arrange buttons in rows and columns, facilitating easy resizing and layout adjustments for different screen sizes.
### Consistent Styling: Maintain consistency in button sizes, fonts, and colors throughout the application for a cohesive user experience.
### Clear Display Area: Ensure the display area provides sufficient space to show input expressions and results clearly.
### Button Functionality: Although not required to implement functional logic, ensure buttons are visually distinguishable and logically grouped based on their respective arithmetic operations.


## Usage

To view the design and explore the implementation details, clone or download the project from the GitHub repository. Open the project in Xcode to examine the UI design and explore the implementation of StackViews and layout constraints.
